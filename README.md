# Pathfinding-Visualizer
 I was always intrigued by how different path finding algorithms looked like visually so I wanted to create one of my own. Hope you guys like it!! 
 You can check it out here: (https://pathfinding-visualizer-811ff.web.app/).
 
 ## Algorithms include:
 
 - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
 - **Depth-first Search(DFS)**
 - **Breadth-first Search(BFS)**
